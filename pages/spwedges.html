            <p>It really doesn't get any easier or cheaper than this. 1 Serving is equal to 2 medium/large potatoes.
                You can use any kind of cooking oil but olive oil does work best. Feel free to add your own spices,
                cajun
                always works very well.

        <div class="instructions">
            <p class="steps">Step 1</p>
            <p class="instruction">Cut your sweet potatoes in half length ways, and continue to do so until you end up
                with that clasic wedge shape you're after.
                If it is a big potato you may want to cut them in half width ways as well, but it's just your
                preference. The main thing is that theyre all similar in size
                so they cook evenly.
            </p>
            <p class="steps">Step 2</p>
            <p class="instruction">Get a large mixing bowl and add the cut potatoes, followed by a large glug of oil.
                Give them a mix and then add your spices, whatever they may be. </p>
            <p class="steps">Step 3</p>
            <p class="instruction">Turn on the oven to 200ºC and get a baking tray out. Add your wedges to the tray, and
                try give them equal spacing as again this will help them cook evenly.
                Stick the tray in the oven.
            </p>
            <p class="steps">Step 4</p>
            <p class="instruction">How long you leave the wedges in is totally up to you as it will be your personal
                preference. We prefer them to crisp up on the outside rather than stil be soft, the best method
                for this is to cook them at a lower heat (around 140ºC) for 30 mins, followed by 15/20 mins at 200ºC. If
                you're pushed for time you can cook at a higher heat to get them done under half an hour. Either way,
                they never disappoint!
