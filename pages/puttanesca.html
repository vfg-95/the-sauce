        <div class="recipe-brief">
            <p>Puttanesca has a lot of variety in the way it's cooked. We've designed our recipe to be as convenient &
                quick
                as possible without any compromise on taste - for this reason we used tinned tomatoes so we dont have to
                chop any up.
                If you want to make extra sauce use two tins of chopped tomatoes, as this is great for saving in the
                fridge or freezer.
                Note that the capers, anchovies & olives pack a lot of flavour so we reccomend going moderate the first
                time you cook this (use half the tin/jar).
            </p>
        </div>
        <p class="steps">Step 1</p>
        <p class="instruction"> Add a healthy glug of olive oil to your pan and put it on a low/medium heat. Chop your
            garlic (we reccomend 3/4 cloves -
            and the method is up to you, just make sure it's chopped equally so it cooks evenly - if you don't know
            where to start with that, check the video <a href="../#garlic-tips">here</a>). Add this to the pan.</p>
        <p class="steps">Step 2</p>
        <p class="instruction">Now roughly chop your anchovies and add these to the pan, along with the chilli flakes -
            add according to your preference!
            Give everything a stir and leave to cook in the pan. You only want to do this for a 3-5 mins keeping an eye
            on the garlic in particular as you don't want this to color much!</p>
        <p class="steps">Step 3</p>
        <p class="instruction">Next up add the tinned tomatoes, give it a good stir and ramp up to a medium/high heat.
            You want to reduce this which will take around 10-15 mins - not forgetting to give it the occasional stir.
            Start thinking about getting your pasta on,
            boil the kettle and add a little salt
            to another pan.</p>
        <p class="steps">Step 4</p>
        <p class="instruction">Onto the capers & olives next, as mentioned there's a lot of flavour with these so add
            moderately to your taste. Wash the capers for 10 seconds under the tap,
            and cut your olives in half length ways. Add these to the sauce, which should be starting to thicken up by
            this point.</p>
        <p class="steps">Step 5</p>
        <p class="instruction">Start to cook your pasta, which we are going to undercook slightly and finish off
            cooking with the sauce in the other pan. This will take around 8/9 mins (providing you have dry pasta!).
            Drain the pasta ensuring you save
            a good amount of the pasta water for the next step.</p>
        <p class="steps">Step 6</p>
        <p class="instruction">Your sauce should be nice & thick by this point and basically ready, if it's still a bit
            watery give it an extra 5 mins.
            Once it is done you can add your pasta to the same pan (if you've made extra sauce for saving, remove this
            beforehand so you can cook with some fresh pasta for next time!)
            Add small amounts of the pasta water and stir until it's been absorbed. Taste the pasta as you go and keep
            going until it's cooked to your preference!.</p>
        <p class="steps">Step 7</p>
        <p class="instruction">Time to serve up. If you've got the additional garnishes go ahead and add those - a
            drizzle of olive oil on top always makes
            a nice addition. Enjoy!</p>
