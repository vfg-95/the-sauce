            <p>Our longest recipe, but a great one for storing in the fridge or freezer once cooked and saving time on
                other nights.
                If you intend on making leftover portions then up the quantities of chickpeas & tinned tomatoes. You'll
                be
                be left with easily 5+ portions that you can bang straight in the microwave. There's quite a lot of
                ingredients
                however you can atill get all this for less than Â£15. If you're tight for cash then skip the optional
                ingredients. The same
                applies to the spices - this will taste good with just curry powder & tumeric.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="instructions">
            <p class="steps">Step 1</p>
            <p class="instruction"> If you're using microwave rice then skip this step - If not then get a cup out. The
                ratio for perfect basmati is 1 and 3/4 cups water to 1 cup of rice, so decide how much you want to use
                and rinse your basmati under cold water for about 1 minute
                and then transfer it to a bowl, then fill with cold water so it's comfortably covered and put it to one
                side. Keep an eye on the time as you need to remove it after about 40 mins.
            </p>
            <p class="steps">Step 2</p>
            <p class="instruction">Get a big pan and add some oil (veg or olive are both fine) and put it on the lowest
                heat. Dice your onion into medium/small size and add to the pan. Don't forget to give them an occasional
                stir.</p>
            <p class="steps">Step 3</p>
            <p class="instruction">Time to prep your garlic, ginger & chillies. For garlic, we typically use around 4/5
                cloves. Finely chop this with your prefered method - Be sure to check out the garlic tip section
                <a href="../#garlic-tips">here</a> if your garlic chopping isn't up to scratch. The ginger can just be
                grated, skin and all. And for the chillies finely slice them, as always it's up to you how much you want
                to add.
                If you aren't sure go with less, you can always add more later (if there is one tip to give for cooking,
                this is it!) Add these all to the pan at the same time and stir for a couple of mins.
            </p>
            <p class="steps">Step 4</p>
            <p class="instruction">Depending on what spices you're using; add 1 tsp curry powder and turmeric, and half
                a tsp of ground coriander to a bowl. If you're also using mustard seeds, and 1 tsp to the pan first and
                leave for another couple of minutes.
                Follow this with the bowl of spice you prepared and leave for another 2 mins, stirring continuously
                until the spices smell nice and toasted. The garam masala will go in towards the very end if you are
                using.
            </p>
            <p class="steps">Step 5</p>
            <p class="instruction">Turn the heat up to medium/high and add the tinned tomatoes and coconut milk (If
                you're cooking your own rice, save around half a can to cook the rice in). You want to get this up to
                boiling and then reduce the heat a bit so you
                have a nice steady simmer, and you can expect it to take about half an hour from this point. Add a
                generous amount of salt and pepper, and give it a taste - you may want to add more chillies.
            </p>
            <p class="steps">Step 6</p>
            <p class="instruction">While the curry is simmering away you can drain the chickpeas, we let the curry
                thicken up for 20 mins before adding them. If you're cooking your own rice then it should be nearly time
                to remove it from it's bowl, so fill and boil the kettle.
                Remember it's 1 & 3/4 cups of water per cup of rice, and you also have half a tin of coconut milk to mix
                with boiled water so include this in your measurement. Add this to another saucepan which has a lid (you
                can also add a pinch of salt & a tsp of butter if you have some). Mix this together,
                and add the rice. Get it up to boiling point then turn it to the lowest heat and put the lid on. This
                will only take 5-10 mins to cook, after 5 mins give it an occasional taste until you're happy with it.
            </p>
            <p class="steps">Step 7</p>
            <p class="instruction">Nearly there guys, the curry should of thickened up nicely (if you have garam masala,
                add 1 tsp now and mix it in) and you can now add your chickpeas. From here it should only need around
                another 5/10 mins!
            </p>
            <p class="steps">Step 8</p>
            <p class="instruction">Time to serve! This is pretty filling so go easy, you can always have seconds. If you
                have the lime and coriander then garnish with these and tuck in.
            </p>
