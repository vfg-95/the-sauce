            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Here at The Sauce our aims are pretty simple. We want to provide you with inexpensive, straight forward, healthy recipes for
                people of all skill levels. Second to that, we want to increase awareness and practise of sustainability in the kitchen as we know this is something
                at the forefront of your mind as you go about your day. The food industry has a big impact on climate change and so 
                it's highly important to us that we share as much as we can to help you improve your cooking skills in a sustainable way!
            </p>
            <p>Please feel free to get in touch with us via the contact page, we are very open to hearing from you guys and would love to develop
                the site so that the user can have some feedback and input into it. If you have anything you'd like to share; general kitchen tips, cost cutting, recipe ideas -
                we'd love to hear them. Please head over to the contact page and drop us an email. If you have something we think is worth sharing we will happily post
                it to the site (with props to you, of course!).
