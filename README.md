# The Sauce

Deployed site: https://vfg-95.github.io/the-sauce/

The Sauce is a cooking and recipe website which aims it's content at younger/inexperienced cooks (especially students) and has an emphasis on sustainability with their cooking. The site will target them by providing cheap and easy recipes in an informal style, as well as share useful tips/content useful to people new to cooking. The site should appeal to it's demographic for two main reasons. Firstly, generally speaking, many young people and students in particular will be cooking properly themseleves for the first time and will want to keep costs down in the process. Secondly, younger generations are stated to be more concerned with sustainability in their lives.
