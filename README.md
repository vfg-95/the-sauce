# The Sauce

Deployed site: https://vfg-95.github.io/the-sauce/

The Sauce is a cooking and recipe website which aims it's content at younger/inexperienced cooks (especially students) and has an emphasis on sustainability with their cooking. The site will target them by providing cheap and easy recipes in an informal style, as well as share useful tips/content useful to people new to cooking. The site should appeal to it's demographic for two main reasons. Firstly, generally speaking, many young people and students in particular will be cooking properly themseleves for the first time and will want to keep costs down in the process. Secondly, younger generations are stated to be more concerned with sustainability in their lives.

# Design

I made up some wireframe images which just gave me a basic guide of how I intended to structure the site and the content to flow.

<img src="./assets/screenshots/p1mockup.png" width="300" height="700">
<img src="./assets/screenshots/p1mockup2.png">

I decided to go for a mobile first design approach for two reasons; firstly with my target audience being younger they would be more likely to browse from their phone. This is amplified by the fact that when cooking in a kitchen using a phone is much more convenient to look at than a laptop, with a desktop being highly unlikely to be used at all whilst actually cooking.

As you can see from the wireframes my inital idea was to mimic a social media style feed on mobile, primarily Instagram as this is the most prevelant social media app used by the target audience. However once I got together the images and content I intended to use I played around with structure etc to come up with something different but maintained the scrollable aspect of an app like Instagram.

## Colour

I then moved onto colour scheme which I knew was going to be very important. I decided to use Earth tones (sky/sea blue, grass green) as this achieved the organisational aim of conveying it's intentions through it's design. This is because of the emphasis on sustainability which the colour scheme matches perfectly, and helps the user buy into the ethos of the site. The colours are also split into categories - the turqoise/sea blue colour is used to reference anything to do with actual recipes. Sky blue is for anything to do with contact information, and finally the green is for general tips. This can be continued into the fuutre development of the site when any new content is added. You can see these from the screenshots below.

## Imagery

In terms of the imagery used these are fairly self explanitory as they are images for the recipes provided, or background shots of meals which arent recipes on the site but of course tie in with the theme and purpose. The image of the Earth from space and also the background of the sustainabiliy page are ones you wouldnt necessarily expect to see on a food website, however again for the target audience they help them buy into the sites aims.

## Fonts

I added quite a few different google fonts so I could play around with them and find a mixture that I thought fit the site. I knew I wanted clean and modern looking fonts for headings, and I ended up using Barlow for the header and footer and then using Archivo for the headings on the site. These made sense as it is a site aimed at a younger target audience and so modern works well. I contrasted this with the Tino font used for paragraph text, which works well as a balance of Serif and San-Serif fonts and gives clear seperation between text.

## Structure

The main idea with structure was to get the main points of the website across as soon as the user landed on the site. I think this is achieved very well by just the imagery alone, even if the user just looks at the photos they immediately see a big photo of food followed by Earth from space. The two main points of the website are conveyed in their respective priority of order; a cooking website, with a care for the Earth & sustainability. 

# Testing

For the testing process I made use of Google Chrome Dev to test the following devices for site responsivity:

-   Moto G4
-   Galaxy S5
-   Pixel 2
-   Pixel 2 XL
-   iPhone 5/SE
-   iPhone 6/7/8
-   iPhone 6/7/8 Plus
-   iPhone X
-   iPad
-   iPad Pro
-   13" MacBook
-   16" MacBook
-   21" iMac
-   27" iMac

I then used my phone (iPhone XR) to test the following browsers:

- Chrome
- Safari
- Firefox
- Edge

## Process

- The first task in testing was to check that all links on the site worked as expected, I found no problems with these across all 4 browsers.

- I then checked that the mail sign up section and button was working so that it took me through to the sign up confirmation page, as well as made sure the email was required before it let you submit. This worked across all browsers.

- Next I tested the responsivity of pseudo classes I used, and here I found some problems (see fix section)

- Last I checked fonts were displaying as expected across all 4 browsers, which they were.

# Lighthouse Testing

My results for desktop came back positive, apart from best practises which seemed to have an issue with the youtube video and security.

For mobile I intially recived the following result

However I went back and made some changes to the size of the images which is where it suggested a lot of the issues were, which did improve the performance. Unfortuntely the best practises was still effected by the same issues as on desktop regarding the youtube video.
